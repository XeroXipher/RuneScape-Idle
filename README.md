# RuneScape-Idle
A Small Text Based Game around RuneScape.

## RuneScape-Idle was created by XeroXipher AKA KrypticJaze on July 23rd, 2024.
As of right now, RuneScabe Idle is nowhere near it finished state.
At the moment I plan to make it a Single Player Idle Game but I may incorporate a MultiPlayer Game around it.

## *This is NOT an RSPS*
***RuneScape Idle is NOT a RuneScape Private Server, It is an Open Source GameMode for people to play***
***I am offering this as Open Source so I offer the License to Host and Play but not to SELL***
***I will probably never make a dime off of this Game, but I hold the Commercial Rights to this Game.***

## The Wiki
Github actually provides a pretty good Wiki for there projects so I will be taking advantage of that...
The Wiki will teach people **How to Play**, **Things to Do*** and maybe even **Modding Rights**

## Conclusion
*Anyways, thank you for your interest in RuneScape Idle and I hope to exceed my expectations.*
